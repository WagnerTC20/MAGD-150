##### My _second lab assignment_ focused on colors and design strategy.  To begin, I created a grid of symmetrical lines; the resulting canvas contained boxes for me to put shapes in.  I used a variety of colors and shapes to make the piece look interesting.  Several boxes were left empty.  The final product was a simple but effective demonstration of how symmetry, color, and organization can help in creating digital art.

#### _Lab assignment five_ was my proudest creation.  I included three interactive functions: mouseClicked, mousePressed, and keyPressed.  There are three main shapes within the canvas that can be played with; only one action will work for each.  If taken further, this idea could be developed into a game where the user has to maintain a computer program and prevent it from exploding.  For now, it's just a basic activity.

#### My _sixth assignment_ was about arrays and moving shapes.  For this, I tethered several circles to strings, and I had them move to the right or downwards.  One ball, though, responds to movement of the mouse.  This application could be expanded upon into a game or purpose that requires user interaction.
